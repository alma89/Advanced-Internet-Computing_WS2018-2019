Docker-based Service Composition Project

# Starting the services
1. Run `docker-compose up` (use `--build` to be sure to rebuild all dockerfiles again)
2. To stop use `docker-compose down`
* Services should be available under `192.168.99.100` when using docker toolbox

# Contributions
Each group member has contributed in equal parts to the project. 
Since we had a few group meetings, we have worked together on services and discussed issues together.
We have also tested and corrected errors together during our group meetings.
The main contributions of each group member:
1. Nourizadeh Barabi Manouchehr: Twitter Service, UI, Docker
2. Gruzdev Ievgenii: Analysis Service, Docker
3. Alma Causevic: Report Service, Docker
4. Eitenberger Christoph: Failover Service, BPMN, Docker

Nevertheless we can say that every group member worked and was involved also on every other part, due to a number of group meetings.
